# Instructions  

Today you will create a dictionary and a list.

For the dictionary, you will create key:value pairs of food prices.
For the list, you will create a list of your playlist.

## Steps
No.| To do
:-:|:-
1| In your "main.py" create a dictionary of a food table with the following key:value pairs: Chicken = 1.59, Beef = 1.99, Cheese = 1.00, & Milk = 2.50. Put these in lines 7-12, making sure to input the keys as strings & to add a comma in between each pair.
2| Access the price for each item and store into their own variable in lines 22-24. Use the milk example in line 18 to model your answer.
3| Print the prices for the 4 items in line 27.
4| Now create playlist, which is a list of the songs in your section's Spotify playlist. Add the songs as strings in line 33.
5| Print the playlist to see all the songs that you added.
6| Index the first song in your playlist in line 41.
7| The 2nd & 3rd songs are your favorite in this playlist. Access them & create a variable called "fave_songs" in line 44. Then print your subset in line 45.
8| Update your playlist by changing the last song to something else. Write this song in line 48. Then print this playlist.
9| Add another song at the end of the list using append() in line 53. Then, print the updated playlist.
10| You changed your mind & want to delete the last song you just added using pop() in line 58. Now print your playlist again.
11| How many songs are in your playlist? Run line 63 & type the answer in line 64.
12| Sort your playlist in alphabetical order using sorted() in line 67. Finally type the songs in the sorted order based on Step 11.


  Use [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) to format your instructions.

  For example, here is a code block in python3
```python
def hello_world():
  print("hello world!")
```


  Include an image by placing it in the `assets` folder.

  For example, here is the Replit logo:
