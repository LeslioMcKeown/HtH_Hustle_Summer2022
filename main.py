# Rename this file here & call it week4_exit.py

## Part I: Create a dictionary

# Create your food table here via key:value pairs
# (input the food & prices from lines 73-76):
food_prices = {



  
  }
print(food_prices)

# Retrieve any value from the food prices dictionary by using its corresponding key along with the bracket notation
# For example, to get the price for cheese, run this:
milk_price = food_prices["milk"]
print(milk_price)

# Access the prices for each item & store into their own variable, just like the milk example.  
chicken_price =
beef_price =
cheese_price

# Print those variables to check that you get the right value. Write the code to print on the line below:
print(    )

## Part II. Create a list of the Spotify playlist

# First, add the songs in your section's list in 
playlist = [
  
]

# Print the playlist in the line below:
print(playlist)

# Lists have an index, which is a number assigned to each item in the list based on the oder in which they appear in the list, starting at 0. 
# What's the first song on your list?
print(playlist[0])

# Pick your top 2 favorite songs from the list & print them using the list's index to access them
fave_songs = playlist[1:2]
print(fave_songs)

# Update your playlist by changing the last song to something else
playlist[2] = " "
# print the playlist to show that you have updated it
print(playlist)

# Add another song to the end of the list using append()
playlist.append(" ")
# print the playlist to show that you added a new song
print(playlist)

# You changed your mind & want to delete the last song you just added
playlist.pop()
# Print the playlist to show that you deleted the last song
print( )

# How many songs are in your list? Use len()
print(len(playlist))
# Write here how many songs are in your playlist = 

# Sort your playlist in alphabetical order using sorted()
print(sorted(playlist))
# Write here the order of the songs in your playlist:
#
